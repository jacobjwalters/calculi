# calculi

This project is a set of different implementations and extensions of type systems for the simply typed lambda calculus (STLC).
Generally, there is a focus on meta variables (metavars).

Currently, the following calculi have been implemented:
- Basic STLC;
- Intrinsically scoped STLC;
- Intrinsically scoped and typed STLC;
- Intrinsically scoped STLC with metavars.

You can play around with the implementations by loading the files in the `src/` directory into an Idris2 session.
